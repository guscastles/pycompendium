### Rationale

The intent of this project is to create a fully operational Dialogue Mapping tool, following the same great pattern established by
the Compendium tool. Using a different technology from the original Java world, the wishful stack tech is as follows:

* Functional programming style, using Python 3 and the Flask web framework.
* Some Javascript framework, added with HTML5 graphical features (ReactJS, Angular, VueJS, anything else?).
* A reliable DBMS, such as PostrgreSQL. I will move away from NoSQL databases for now, but I reckon the Ecto module can create the wrapper for 
any DB layer without any problem.
* Some machine learning behind the scenes, probably (just for fun!)
* Graph handling layer is needed.

I will be adding the initial User Story Mapping for the project in the coming days.

Cheers!
